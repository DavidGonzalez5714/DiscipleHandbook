<h1>Accept Christ</h1>
<div> 
    <p>
        Accepting Christ is the first step to becoming a Disciple of Jesus Christ. Once you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, His Holy Spirit lives within you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Jesus wants you.</strong> Your past doesn’t exempt you from His love. All you need to do is accept Him as
        your Lord and Savior and acknowledge that Jesus died for your sins on the cross and you will be saved. </div>

    <h2>How</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <p>Romans 10:9-10 says:</p>
        <p>&#8220;9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from
            the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with
            your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.&#8221; </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Ephesians 2:8-9 says:</p>
        <p> &#8220;8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the
            gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast.&#8221; </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The Prayer</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Heavenly Father, I stand here today, in your presence, I ask you to forgive me of every sin I’ve ever
            committed. I acknowledge and confess my sinfulness to you. I believe that Jesus died for my sins and that he
            rose from the grave and that He can live in my heart today. Jesus come into my life and help me to live for
            you in the days ahead. I confess that you are my Savior and my Lord. In Jesus name, Amen!</p>
