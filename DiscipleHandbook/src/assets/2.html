        <p>Matthew 6:9-13 says:</p>
        <p>&#8220;9 “This, then, is how you should pray:
        <p>&#8220; ‘Our Father in heaven,<br /> hallowed be your name,<br /> 10 your kingdom come,<br /> your will be
            done,<br /> on earth as it is in heaven.<br /> 11 Give us today our daily bread.<br /> 12 And forgive us our
            debts,<br /> as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br /> 13 And lead us not into temptation,<br /> but
            deliver us from the evil one.’<br /> </p>
