    <h2> Work the word </h2>
    <p> God’s word is satisfying. Meaning, you don’t always need to read many verses, but if you work the same verse or
        chapter over and over, He can interpret it for you. It is more important to fully understand the word God is
        speaking to you through His Word. Allow The Spirit to guide your understanding. </p>
