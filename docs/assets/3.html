    <h2>1. Worship</h2>
    <h3>
        Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise (Psalms 100:4 (NIV))
    </h2>
    <p>
        Worship is about acknowledging who God is. 
        We place our situation in context of <strong>whose</strong> we are. 
        When we worship through song, we declare with our mouths that Jesus is our Lord and savior and He is greater than the situation that we face.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why do we worship God?
    </h3>
    <p>
        We worship God because He is worthy of our praise which means, He is worth our worship. 
        Jesus is constantly working in our lives. We worship the God who is continuously working in our lives. 
        He vigorously pursues a relationship with us.

        2. Read the Bible Daily
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you already have a Bible, open it up and start reading! 
        Some Study Bibles will have a Subject Guide in the back of the Bible.
        Study Bibles also clarify the Bible and provide additional context.
        Don’t have a Bible? The Bible is online @ <a href="https://www.bible.com" target="_blank">https://www.bible.com</a>!
    </p>

    <h2>3. Work the word </h2>
    <p> God’s word is satisfying. You don’t always need to read many verses, but if you work the same verse or
        chapter over and over, He can interpret it for you. It is more important to fully understand the word God is
        speaking to you through His Word. Allow The Spirit to guide your understanding. </p>
