<h1>How to Pray</h1>
<div>
    <h2>What is Prayer</h2>    
    <p>
        Prayer is talking to and seeking God. He is described as a “Wonderful, Counselor”, “Prince of Peace”. Prayer is a time when we talk to God about our concerns, questions, and anything else we need to discuss with Him. 
    </p>
    <p>Isaiah 9:6</p>
    <p>
        For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called <strong>Wonderful, Counselor,</strong> Mighty God, Everlasting Father, <strong> Prince of Peace.</strong>

    <h2>Power of Prayer</h2>
    <p>
        Although simple, prayer is powerful. God hears us. The bible says in Matthew 7: 7-8: <span style="color:red"> “7 Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.”</span>

    <h2>It's about a relationship</h2>
    <p>
        God wants us to talk to Him and prayer is an essential aspect of building a relationship
        with God. Not only does God listen, but He also speaks to us. Not like a Human speaks to another human. It’s more like an impression. 
        As you continue to pray and ask God questions, sometimes revelations will come to you. 
        Other times you will discover Bible verses that speak to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can easily talk to Him in your thoughts or out loud. There is no wrong way to pray. Just talk to your Father.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Jeremiah 33:3 God says "3 ‘Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’"

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <div> In Matthew 6:5-15 Jesus gives us this example. He notes that prayer is to be simple and humble.</div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Matthew 6:9-13 says:</p>
            <p>&#8220;9 “This, then, is how you should pray:
            <p>&#8220; ‘Our Father in heaven,<br /> hallowed be your name,<br /> 10 your kingdom come,<br /> your will be
                done,<br /> on earth as it is in heaven.<br /> 11 Give us today our daily bread.<br /> 12 And forgive us our
                debts,<br /> as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br /> 13 And lead us not into temptation,<br /> but
                deliver us from the evil one.’<br /> </p>
